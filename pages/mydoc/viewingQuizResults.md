The link below will take you to MapleTA, the quizzing software.  Once there, click on "Gradebook" -> "View Past Results".  This will take you to a page that lists all of your attempts on all of the quizzes you have taken.  Click on a link to reveal your answers and my correct solutions to the problems.  Please note that sometimes mapleTA does a less-than-stellar job of grading your work.  In cases where it is clear that you should have received credit but you didn't, please point it out to me on your weekly corrections and I will update your grade.
