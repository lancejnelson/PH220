    "When a charged particle is projected into a uniform magnetic field, the trajectory of the particle is helical, with the axis of the helix pointing in the same direction as the magnetic field.  Let's assume that a positively charged particle ($q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C $m = 9.109 \\times 10^{-23}$ kg) is shot into a constant magnetic field given by:\n",
